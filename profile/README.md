# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to the KygekTeam GitHub organization profile page!

We've made many open source projects **since 2020**, mainly **plugins for Minecraft server software** (PocketMine-MP 3/4, NukkitX/PowerNukkit, SpigotMC/PaperMC). KygekTeam is founded by [**@KygekDev**](https://github.com/KygekDev) on 2020, previously named **Kygek Development**.

We really hope our projects may help **you and other people**! If you have any **feedbacks or suggestions**, don't be afraid to let us know in the [**KygekTeam Feedback**](https://feedback.kygekteam.org) website.

For more information about us, please visit our [**main website**](https://kygek.team) as well as the [**about**](https://kygek.team/about) page in the same website.
